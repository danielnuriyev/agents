  Write a Python function that finds the maximum even number in a list of integers.
  The function should be named find_max_even and take a list of integers as input.
  If there are no even numbers in the list, return None.
  Handle edge cases like empty lists gracefully.

  IMPORTANT: You must write the actual function code and test it by running several examples.
  Include the function code AND the test execution results in your output.
