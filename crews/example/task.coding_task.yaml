  Write a Python function that finds the maximum even number in a list of integers.
  The function should be named find_max_even and take a list of integers as input.
  If there are no even numbers in the list, return None.
  Handle edge cases like empty lists gracefully.

  IMPORTANT: You must write the actual function code and test it by running several examples.
  Include the function code AND the test execution results in your output.
  Use the following structure for your code:
  ```python
  def find_max_even(int_list):
      # your code here
      pass

  # Test cases
  print(find_max_even([1, 2, 3, 4]))
  ```
  
  NOTE: For the purpose of testing the iterative fix loop, please intentionally 
  include a small bug in your first implementation (e.g., return the minimum 
  even number instead of maximum) so that the testers can catch it and we can 
  see the fix loop in action.
