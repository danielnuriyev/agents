  Create, EXECUTE, and VERIFY unit tests for the find_max_even function.
  Test these specific cases and report actual execution results:

  REQUIRED TESTS:
  - Lists with multiple even numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → should return 4)
  - Lists with one even number (e.g., [1, 3, 6] → should return 6)
  - Lists with odd numbers only (e.g., [1, 3, 5] → should return None)
  - Empty lists ([] → should return None)
  - Lists with negative numbers (e.g., [-2, -1, 0, 2] → should return 2)

  IMPORTANT: Write the test code, actually run it, and show:
  - The complete test code
  - Execution results for each test case
  - Clear PASS/FAIL status for each test
  - Summary of test results
