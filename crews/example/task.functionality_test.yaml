  Create, EXECUTE, and VERIFY unit tests for the find_max_even function.
  Test these specific cases and report actual execution results:

  REQUIRED TESTS:
  - Lists with multiple even numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → should return 4)
  - Lists with one even number (e.g., [1, 3, 6] → should return 6)
  - Lists with odd numbers only (e.g., [1, 3, 5] → should return None)
  - Empty lists ([] → should return None)
  - Lists with negative numbers (e.g., [-2, -1, 0, 2] → should return 2)

  IMPORTANT: You must provide the COMPLETE Python test code in a ```python ... ``` block.
  The code must be self-contained (except for importing find_max_even).
  Each test case must be a function starting with 'test_'.
  Include a main block to run the tests.
  
  Example structure:
  ```python
  import find_max_even
  
  def test_example():
      assert find_max_even.find_max_even([2, 4]) == 4
      print("test_example: PASS")
      
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      test_example()
  ```
