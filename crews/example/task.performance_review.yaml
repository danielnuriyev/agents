  Execute performance benchmarks and analyze the find_max_even function efficiency:

  PERFORMANCE TESTS REQUIRED:
  - Time execution with small lists (10 elements)
  - Time execution with medium lists (1,000 elements)
  - Time execution with large lists (100,000 elements)
  - Measure memory usage patterns
  - Analyze time complexity (should be O(n))
  - Test scalability with increasing input sizes

  IMPORTANT: Write and execute benchmark code.
  Report:
  - Actual execution times for different input sizes
  - Time complexity analysis with evidence
  - Performance bottlenecks identified
  - Optimization recommendations with expected improvements

  Use the following structure for your benchmark code:
  ```python
  def test_performance_large_list():
      # ...
      print("test_performance_large_list: PASS")
  ```
agent: agent.performance_tester
context:
  - task.coding_task
expected_output: Executed performance benchmarks with timing data and optimization analysis
