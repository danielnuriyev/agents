description: |
  Execute comprehensive validation tests to prove the find_max_even function meets ALL specifications:

  VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - Returns the maximum even number from a list (e.g., [1, 8, 4, 6] → 8)
  - Returns None when no even numbers exist (e.g., [1, 3, 5] → None)
  - Handles empty lists correctly ([] → None)
  - Works with negative even numbers (e.g., [-4, -2, 1] → -2)
  - Correctly identifies maximum among multiple even numbers ([2, 8, 4] → 8)

  IMPORTANT: You must provide the COMPLETE Python test code in a ```python ... ``` block.
  The code must be self-contained (except for importing find_max_even).
  Each test case must be a function starting with 'test_'.
  Include a main block to run the tests.
  
  Example structure:
  ```python
  import find_max_even
  
  def test_spec_example():
      assert find_max_even.find_max_even([2, 4]) == 4
      print("test_spec_example: PASS")
      
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      test_spec_example()
  ```
