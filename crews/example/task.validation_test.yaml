  Execute comprehensive validation tests to prove the find_max_even function meets ALL specifications:

  VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - Returns the maximum even number from a list (e.g., [1, 8, 4, 6] → 8)
  - Returns None when no even numbers exist (e.g., [1, 3, 5] → None)
  - Handles empty lists correctly ([] → None)
  - Works with negative even numbers (e.g., [-4, -2, 1] → -2)
  - Correctly identifies maximum among multiple even numbers ([2, 8, 4] → 8)

  IMPORTANT: Create and run validation tests that prove each requirement.
  Show:
  - Test code for each validation case
  - Actual execution results
  - Verification that each spec is met
  - Any edge cases discovered
