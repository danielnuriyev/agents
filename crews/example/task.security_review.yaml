  Execute security tests to identify and demonstrate vulnerabilities in the find_max_even function:

  SECURITY TESTS TO RUN:
  - Denial of Service: Test with extremely large inputs (1M+ elements)
  - Input Validation: Test with malicious data types (strings, None, objects)
  - Resource Exhaustion: Test memory usage with large inputs
  - Type Safety: Test with unexpected input types (int, str, dict)
  - Boundary Conditions: Test with edge cases that could cause issues

  IMPORTANT: You must provide the COMPLETE Python test code in a ```python ... ``` block.
  The code must be self-contained (except for importing find_max_even).
  Each test case must be a function starting with 'test_'.
  Include a main block to run the tests.
  
  Example structure:
  ```python
  import find_max_even
  
  def test_security_example():
      # ...
      print("test_security_example: PASS")
      
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      test_security_example()
  ```
