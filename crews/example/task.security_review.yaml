  Execute security tests to identify and demonstrate vulnerabilities in the find_max_even function:

  SECURITY TESTS TO RUN:
  - Denial of Service: Test with extremely large inputs (1M+ elements)
  - Input Validation: Test with malicious data types (strings, None, objects)
  - Resource Exhaustion: Test memory usage with large inputs
  - Type Safety: Test with unexpected input types (int, str, dict)
  - Boundary Conditions: Test with edge cases that could cause issues

  IMPORTANT: Write and execute security test code.
  Report:
  - Test code that attempts each attack vector
  - Actual execution results showing vulnerabilities or safe handling
  - Severity assessment for each identified issue
  - Recommended security fixes with code examples
